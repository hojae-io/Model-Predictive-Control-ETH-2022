% BRIEF:
%   Template for explicit invariant set computation. You MUST NOT change

% INPUT:
%   Q, R: State and input weighting matrix
% OUTPUT:
%   H, h: Describes polytopic X_LQR = {x | H * x <= h}

    Hu = params.constraints.InputMatrix;
    hu = params.constraints.InputRHS;
    A = params.model.A;
    B = params.model.B;

    ctrl = LQR(Q,R,params);
    P = polytope([Hx;Hu*ctrl.K],[hx;hu]);
